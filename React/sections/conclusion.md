# Conclusion


## State of Modern Web Development
Especially in the world of modern web development, open source has become an integral part of everyone's life. On one hand, developing applications has become easier and the time and efforts from ideas to prototypes to ready to use software can be kept as short as never. All by making use of open source libraries and frameworks. On the other hand, giving back to the community and contributing to open source, has also become much easier. With tools like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or [BitBucket](https://www.bitbucket.com) where most of today's open source code is hosted, practically everyone has the ability to step in and make a contribution.

## On Giant's Shoulders
As discussed in earlier chapters, ReactJS was first developed by Facebook and only after several years of internal usages opensourced and made available to broad public. The ideas behind the framework, the challenges such a big platform is facing and enormous manpower behind the project ensure longevity and ongoing support. 

## Contributing
While the core contributors team is a full time dedicated team of Facebook's software engineers, as a truly open source project, everyone can and many indeed do contribute to the project. As previously mentioned, React's core team creates a very welcoming environment and presents very [well documented guidelines](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/how-to-contribute.html) for contributors. There is even a [list of *beginner friendly* issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Difficulty%3A+beginner%22). On top of the, the core team is values openness and transparency, that there is a separate [repository](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes/) for core team's meeting notes freely acccessible for everyone to read and comment on.


## Process & Quality
With such a big reach and framework success comes big responsibilty for code quality. The list of [Sites Using React](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react) appears not even to scratch the surface, but presents an overview of bigger sites and companies using ReactJS in their products.

One can argue that on of the reasons for such broad adoption of the framework is indeed its uniqe architecture, code quality and ease of use. 

As we saw in the section [Metrics, Variability and Quality Measures](Metrics, Variability and Quality Measures), the React codebase is a very large one, presenting challenges large oepn source codebases usually do, like *distributed knowledge*, *code hotspots* and sometimes increasing *complexity*. 

There is also the fact, that the teem seems not to follow any particular development methodology as mentioned in of the previous sections. On the other hand we find that a lot of thought was given to designing the collaborating process, without giving it a formal name, and the process seems to work very smoothly and efficiently. 

The fact of wide adoption, even not directly connected to code quality, shows that the code works as expected and works in a reliable way.
