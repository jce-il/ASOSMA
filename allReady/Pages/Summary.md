
# Summary #

allReady (& Humanitarian Toolbox) is a project dedicated for contributing to the community preparing for and while disasters situations using skills developers have.  

It faces some challenges that are uncommon for a software project (taking in consideration unstable environment like - no reliable internet connection) while the mission of the software might be vital, as well as common open source challenges (e.g. keeping quality of code base with over 100 contributors - all volunteers).    

Facing those challenges, allReady has come up with software solutions (taking advantage of SMS for communication, sending sparse messages when opportunity is available etc...) and standardization solutions (detailed guides for contribution, unit & UI tests, CI).  

Most of the time writing this chapter was spent on collecting information from varies sources and trying to put it together into one coherent document. Since we did not find a self-contained source overviewing the project from an architecture / meta point of view I am not sure to what extent the data we have collected is correct / full.
