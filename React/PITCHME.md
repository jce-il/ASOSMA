## Introduction

+++ 

React is an open-source Javascript library, firstly develop by Facebook and used by a lot of very big companies (like Airbnb, Reddit, SalesForce, Twitter, WhatsApp and of course Facebook and Instagram). React processes only user interfaces in applications. This is the View in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) template.
